# sm64ex-coop
Online multiplayer mod for SM64, aiming to synchronize all entities and every level for multiple players.
Fork of [sm64pc/sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex). 

Build instructions are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/djoslin0/sm64ex-coop/wiki).

## Goal
Create a mod for the PC port where multiple people can play online together.
Unlike previous online attempts, this one will synchronize enemies and events such that you will be interacting with the same world at the same time.
